"Congratulations! You've won £2.5 million in the National Lottery!" The letter looks official. The phone call sounds legitimate. Your parent is already imagining what they'll do with the money.

There's just one catch: they need to pay a small "processing fee" to claim their prize.

It's a scam. It's always a scam.

Lottery and sweepstakes fraud is the fifth most reported scam targeting seniors, with victims aged 70-79 losing a median of £2,000—more than double the general population's losses.

## How Lottery Scams Work

### The Notification

Victims receive contact—by post, phone, email, or text—announcing they've won a prize. Common approaches include:

- **Official-looking letters** with fake company logos and legal language
- **Phone calls** from "prize coordinators" with reference numbers
- **Emails** claiming lottery wins in foreign countries
- **Social media messages** announcing contest wins

### The Hook

The prize sounds legitimate:
- Publishers Clearing House sweepstakes
- National Lottery international division
- Microsoft/Google promotional giveaway
- Foreign lottery (often Jamaica, Netherlands, or Spain)

### The Fee

To claim their winnings, victims must pay:
- "Processing fees"
- "Tax payments"
- "Insurance costs"
- "Customs duties"
- "Verification charges"

These fees start small—£50 or £100—but escalate rapidly.

### The Escalation

Once a victim pays, scammers return with more "fees":
- "Your payment cleared, but we need the tax portion separately"
- "Customs requires additional documentation fees"
- "Your prize has increased—new processing fee required"

Victims have paid tens of thousands before realising there is no prize.

## Why Seniors Are Targeted

### Hope and Dreams

Many seniors on fixed incomes genuinely dream of financial windfalls. The possibility of winning feels real and exciting.

### Trust in Institutions

Names like Publishers Clearing House are familiar and trusted. Seniors may not realise scammers impersonate these brands.

### Isolation

Lonely seniors may be excited by any positive news and less likely to verify with family members.

### Generational Politeness

Many seniors feel obligated to engage with callers rather than hanging up immediately.

## Warning Signs of Lottery Scams

### You Didn't Enter

The number one rule: **You cannot win a contest you didn't enter.** If you don't remember entering, you didn't win.

### Upfront Fees Required

Legitimate lotteries **never** require winners to pay fees. Real prizes have taxes deducted from winnings, not paid separately.

### Payment via Unusual Methods

Requests for gift cards, wire transfers, cryptocurrency, or prepaid debit cards are always fraudulent. Real lotteries accept standard payment methods.

### Pressure to Act Quickly

"You must claim within 24 hours!" creates false urgency. Legitimate prizes allow reasonable time to claim.

### Secrecy Requests

"Don't tell anyone until the money arrives." Scammers know family members will recognise fraud.

### Foreign Origin

Legitimate UK and US lotteries don't require participation from abroad. Foreign lottery notifications are almost always scams.

## Real Publishers Clearing House: The Truth

Publishers Clearing House (PCH) is a real company that does give away prizes. However:

- **PCH will never call asking for payment**
- **PCH will never ask for fees to claim prizes**
- **PCH representatives don't request gift cards**
- **PCH winners are notified by mail and in person (with cameras)**

In April 2025, the FTC sent over £18 million in refunds to consumers deceived by PCH impersonators.

## Real Stories

### The Retirement Dream

Thomas, 76, received a letter announcing he'd won £3.2 million. The "lottery commission" required £500 for processing. Excited, he paid. Then came requests for tax fees, insurance fees, and transfer fees.

Over four months, Thomas sent £47,000—his entire retirement savings—before his daughter discovered the empty accounts.

The prize didn't exist.

### The Jamaican Lottery

Margaret, 81, received calls from a friendly-sounding man claiming she'd won a Jamaican lottery. He called daily, building a relationship while extracting "fees."

Margaret refinanced her home to pay £180,000 in total fees before neighbours intervened.

Jamaica is a major source of lottery scams targeting North American and UK seniors.

## Protecting Your Parents

### Have the Conversation

Explain the simple rule: **You can't win contests you didn't enter, and real prizes never require payment.**

### Watch for Warning Signs

Be alert if your parent mentions:
- Winning something they don't remember entering
- Needing to send money to receive money
- Secret prizes they're not supposed to discuss
- New "friends" from lottery organisations

### Intercept Suspicious Mail

Help your parents recognise official-looking scam letters. Legitimate organisations don't send cheques with invoices.

### Block Scam Calls

Use call-blocking apps and register with the Telephone Preference Service (UK) or Do Not Call Registry (US).

### Monitor Financial Activity

Watch for unusual purchases of gift cards or wire transfers—common payment methods for lottery scams.

## If Your Parent Is Already Involved

### Don't Shame Them

They believed something wonderful was happening. Shame prevents future disclosure.

### Stop All Payments Immediately

Even if they believe the prize is real, no more payments until the situation is verified.

### Report the Scam

Contact:
- **Action Fraud** (UK): 0300 123 2040
- **FTC** (US): reportfraud.ftc.gov
- **Your local police** for documentation

### Expect Continued Contact

Scammers don't give up easily. Your parent may receive more calls claiming new prizes or offering to "help recover" lost money. These are also scams.

### Provide Emotional Support

Your parent has experienced loss—both financial and emotional. The dream of winning was real to them, even if the prize wasn't.

## The Recovery Scam

A particularly cruel variation: After losing money to a lottery scam, victims receive calls from "government agencies" or "fraud recovery specialists" offering to recover their losses—for a fee.

This is a second scam targeting the same victims. Legitimate agencies never charge fees for fraud recovery.

## The Simple Rules

1. **You can't win what you didn't enter**
2. **Real prizes never require upfront payment**
3. **Legitimate lotteries don't request gift cards**
4. **If it sounds too good to be true, it is**
