Here's something that might surprise you: Financial problems are often the first observable sign of Alzheimer's disease—appearing up to six years before formal diagnosis.

Your parent's bounced cheque, unusual purchase, or susceptibility to a scam might not be "just getting older." It might be an early warning sign that demands attention.

More than 7 million older adults manage household finances while experiencing some level of cognitive impairment. Understanding the connection between cognitive decline and financial vulnerability could help you protect your parents—and potentially identify problems earlier.

## The Brain-Finance Connection

### Why Finances Are Affected First

Managing money requires complex cognitive functions:
- **Executive function**: Planning, decision-making, impulse control
- **Memory**: Remembering bills, account numbers, financial commitments
- **Attention**: Tracking multiple accounts and transactions
- **Numerical processing**: Understanding amounts, percentages, comparisons
- **Judgment**: Evaluating legitimacy of offers and requests

These functions are among the first affected by cognitive decline. Financial difficulties can emerge while daily living tasks still seem manageable.

### The Research

A groundbreaking 2025 study analysed banking data from thousands of older adults, comparing those who later needed power of attorney (indicating cognitive decline) with those who didn't.

**Key findings:**
- Financial warning signs appeared up to **10 years** before formal intervention was needed
- **5 years before** POA: 9.6% less likely to spend on travel
- **5 years before** POA: 7.9% less likely to spend on hobbies
- Increased reports of lost cards, fraud concerns, PIN reset requests
- Changes in spending patterns toward home-based purchases

### The Scam Susceptibility Connection

Research from the University of Southern California found that vulnerability to financial scams may be an early indicator of Alzheimer's disease.

The entorhinal cortex—one of the first brain regions affected by Alzheimer's—plays a crucial role in financial decision-making. As this region deteriorates, people become more susceptible to fraud.

**This means scam vulnerability isn't just costly—it may be diagnostic.**

## Early Warning Signs in Financial Behaviour

### Bill Payment Problems
- Missing payments that were always made on time
- Paying the same bill multiple times
- Confusion about which bills have been paid
- Letting subscriptions or insurance lapse unintentionally

### Calculation Difficulties
- Trouble making change
- Difficulty calculating tips
- Confusion about account balances
- Problems understanding statements

### Unusual Purchases
- Buying things they already have
- Impulse purchases unlike their normal behaviour
- Falling for offers they would have previously rejected
- Stockpiling items unnecessarily

### Transaction Confusion
- Forgetting about withdrawals
- Not recognising charges they made
- Confusion about credit vs. debit
- Inability to explain recent financial activity

### Increased Scam Vulnerability
- Responding to obvious scam emails or calls
- Giving money to strangers
- Inability to recognise suspicious requests
- Repeat victimisation despite previous warnings

### Administrative Failures
- Unfiled taxes
- Expired registrations or licences
- Lapsed insurance policies
- Unopened financial mail

## The Challenge of Early Detection

### Denial and Shame

People experiencing cognitive decline often:
- Minimise or deny problems
- Feel shame about difficulties
- Avoid situations that reveal deficits
- Become defensive when questioned

### Compensation Strategies

Early-stage decline often goes unnoticed because people develop workarounds:
- Relying more heavily on routines
- Having others handle complex tasks
- Avoiding financial discussions
- Using notes and reminders extensively

### Family Distance

Adult children may not see day-to-day patterns:
- Phone calls don't reveal financial management
- Visits are often "good days"
- Parents hide problems to preserve independence
- Financial details aren't typically discussed

## Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) vs. Normal Ageing

Not all memory changes indicate dementia. Normal ageing includes:
- Occasional forgetfulness
- Slower processing speed
- Needing more time for complex decisions

**Concerning signs include:**
- Consistent pattern of financial errors
- Increasing frequency of problems
- Difficulty with previously routine tasks
- Poor judgment in financial decisions
- Inability to learn from mistakes

MCI is a middle ground—more than normal ageing but less than dementia. Importantly, people with MCI may be MORE vulnerable to scams than those with severe dementia, because they still manage their own affairs but with impaired judgment.

## How to Approach This Sensitively

### Start with Observation

Before confronting your parent:
- Review bank and credit card statements (if you have access)
- Check for unopened mail or piled bills
- Look for duplicate purchases
- Note any mentions of unusual transactions

### Use Indirect Approaches

Instead of "I think you have dementia":
- "I've been hearing about sophisticated scams lately—have you gotten any strange calls?"
- "Would it be helpful if I helped with the bills sometimes?"
- "I set up alerts on my bank account—want me to help you do the same?"

### Involve Professionals

If you're concerned:
- Suggest a routine check-up with their doctor
- Ask if cognitive screening can be included
- Consider a geriatric assessment
- Consult with an elder law attorney about protective measures

### Don't Wait for a Crisis

The time to establish protections is while your parent still has capacity:
- Set up power of attorney documents
- Designate trusted contacts with financial institutions
- Create joint monitoring arrangements
- Establish account alerts

## Protective Measures

### Financial Safeguards

**Monitoring without control:**
- Bank account alerts for large transactions
- Trusted contact designations (banks can alert you to concerns)
- Regular statement review
- Credit monitoring services

**Shared oversight:**
- Joint account access for monitoring
- Two-signature requirements for large transactions
- Daily withdrawal limits
- Read-only access to accounts

**Full protection (when needed):**
- Power of attorney activation
- Representative payee for benefits
- Guardianship or conservatorship (last resort)

### Scam Protection

People with cognitive decline need additional protection:
- Call blocking on phones
- Reduced mail solicitation
- AI-powered scam detection
- Family alerts for suspicious communications
- Limited access to accounts for large transfers

### Maintaining Dignity

Protection should preserve independence where possible:
- Involve your parent in decisions
- Explain changes as helping, not controlling
- Maintain their autonomy in areas where they're capable
- Focus on what they CAN do, not what they can't

## When to Take Action

### Yellow Flags (Increased Monitoring)
- Occasional missed payments
- One scam near-miss
- Minor confusion about finances
- Difficulty with new financial technology

### Orange Flags (Active Intervention)
- Pattern of financial errors
- Scam victimisation
- Significant balance discrepancies
- Inability to manage complex bills

### Red Flags (Immediate Action)
- Repeated scam victimisation
- Large unexplained losses
- Complete financial disorganisation
- Evidence of exploitation by others

## The Difficult Truth

Cognitive decline is progressive. If you're seeing financial warning signs, they will likely worsen over time.

Early intervention:
- Protects more assets
- Allows your parent more input in planning
- Reduces crisis decision-making
- Provides better long-term outcomes

Waiting until a major loss forces action means:
- Less money to protect
- Decisions made under pressure
- Reduced options
- Greater family conflict
