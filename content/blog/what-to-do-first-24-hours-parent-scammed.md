You just found out your parent has been scammed. Maybe they sent gift cards to someone claiming to be you. Maybe they wired money to a "romantic partner." Maybe they gave a "Microsoft technician" access to their bank accounts.

The next 24 hours are critical. Here's exactly what to do.

## First: Take a Breath

Before taking action, pause for 30 seconds. Your parent is probably terrified and ashamed. Your reaction in the next few minutes will determine whether they trust you going forward—or hide future problems out of fear.

**What to say:**
> "I'm glad you told me. This isn't your fault—these scammers are professionals. Let's figure out what to do together."

**What NOT to say:**
> "How could you fall for this?"
> "I told you to be careful!"
> "Why didn't you call me first?"

Shame prevents future disclosure. Right now, you need information.

## Hour 1: Gather Information

Before contacting anyone, understand what happened.

### Ask These Questions

1. **What exactly happened?** Get the timeline of events
2. **How much money was sent?** Total amount across all transactions
3. **How was it sent?** Wire transfer, gift cards, cryptocurrency, bank transfer
4. **What information was shared?** Passwords, Social Security numbers, bank details
5. **Do you still have contact information?** Phone numbers, email addresses, website URLs
6. **Is there ongoing contact?** Are scammers still reaching out?

### Document Everything

Write down or photograph:
- Any phone numbers or emails the scammer used
- Gift card numbers and receipts
- Transaction records
- Screenshots of messages
- Websites they were directed to

This documentation will be essential for reports and potential recovery.

## Hours 1-2: Financial Damage Control

### Contact Financial Institutions Immediately

**If money was wired:**
Call the bank's fraud department. Wire transfers can sometimes be reversed if caught within 24-48 hours. Time is critical.

**If gift cards were purchased:**
Contact each gift card company immediately:
- **Amazon**: 888-280-4331
- **Apple/iTunes**: 800-275-2273
- **Google Play**: Through Google Pay support
- **Target**: 800-544-2943
- **Walmart**: 800-925-6278

Some companies can freeze unredeemed cards. Provide card numbers and PINs.

**If cryptocurrency was sent:**
Contact the exchange used (Coinbase, etc.) to report fraud. Recovery is unlikely but sometimes possible.

**If bank account information was shared:**
- Change online banking passwords immediately
- Request new account numbers
- Enable additional verification
- Set up fraud alerts

### Freeze Credit Reports

If personal information was compromised, freeze credit at all three bureaus:

- **Equifax**: 800-685-1111
- **Experian**: 888-397-3742
- **TransUnion**: 888-909-8872

Credit freezes prevent scammers from opening new accounts.

## Hours 2-4: Official Reports

### File Police Report

Visit or call your local police department to file a report. This creates an official record that may be needed for:
- Insurance claims
- Bank disputes
- Identity theft resolution
- Legal proceedings

Get a copy of the report number.

### Report to Federal Agencies

**In the UK:**
- **Action Fraud**: 0300 123 2040 or actionfraud.police.uk
- **National Trading Standards**: For scams involving goods/services

**In the US:**
- **FTC**: reportfraud.ftc.gov
- **FBI IC3**: ic3.gov (for internet crimes)
- **National Elder Fraud Hotline**: 833-FRAUD-11 (833-372-8311)

**For specific scam types:**
- **Social Security scams**: oig.ssa.gov/report
- **IRS impersonation**: TIGTA.gov
- **Medicare fraud**: 1-800-MEDICARE

### Report to Platform Used

If the scam occurred through a specific platform:
- **Facebook/Meta**: Through their help center
- **Dating apps**: Through app settings
- **Email providers**: Forward phishing emails to abuse@[provider].com

## Hours 4-8: Secure Remaining Accounts

### Change Passwords

If the scammer had any computer access, assume all passwords are compromised. Change:
- Email accounts (this is most critical)
- Banking and financial accounts
- Social media accounts
- Any account using the same password

Use strong, unique passwords for each account.

### Enable Two-Factor Authentication

Add 2FA to all important accounts. This prevents access even if passwords are stolen.

### Check for Malware

If remote access was granted:
- Run full antivirus scan
- Consider professional malware removal
- Check for unfamiliar programs installed
- Review browser extensions

### Monitor Email

Watch for:
- Password reset requests you didn't initiate
- Account notification changes
- Unusual sent emails
- New forwarding rules

## Hours 8-24: Support and Prevention

### Address Emotional Impact

Your parent has experienced a significant trauma. They may feel:
- Shame and embarrassment
- Anger at themselves and the scammer
- Fear about financial security
- Anxiety about future threats

Be patient. Listen without judgment. Consider:
- A call to their doctor if distress is severe
- Support groups for scam victims (AARP has resources)
- Professional counselling if needed

### Begin Recovery Planning

Once immediate damage is controlled:
- Review total financial impact
- Assess identity theft risk
- Plan for monitoring accounts going forward
- Discuss ongoing protection measures

### Install Protective Measures

Before the next scam attempt:
- Set up call blocking on their phone
- Enable bank transaction alerts
- Consider credit monitoring services
- Implement family verification protocols (safe word)
- Consider AI-powered scam detection tools

## The Recovery Timeline

**Week 1**: Monitor all accounts closely. Expect more fraud attempts—scammers often sell victim information.

**Weeks 2-4**: Follow up on all reports filed. Contact financial institutions about dispute resolution.

**Month 2-3**: Continue monitoring. Unfreeze credit only when necessary.

**Ongoing**: Maintain protective measures. Have regular check-ins about suspicious contacts.

## What You Can Realistically Recover

### Likely recoverable:
- Credit card charges (dispute within 60 days)
- Some bank transfers (if caught within 24-48 hours)
- Unredeemed gift cards (sometimes)

### Unlikely recoverable:
- Wire transfers (after 24-48 hours)
- Cryptocurrency
- Redeemed gift cards
- Cash withdrawals

### Worth pursuing:
- Insurance claims (some homeowner's policies cover fraud)
- Legal action (rarely successful but sometimes possible)
- Victim compensation funds (varies by jurisdiction)

## Preventing the Next Attack

Scammers share victim lists. Your parent will likely be targeted again. Before that happens:

1. **Establish clear family protocols** for emergency requests
2. **Set up a family safe word** for identity verification
3. **Create a "call me first" rule** for any financial requests
4. **Enable protective technology** that monitors for scam patterns

## The Most Important Thing

Your parent trusted you enough to tell you what happened—or trusted you enough that you could discover it without them hiding it.

That trust is more valuable than any money lost. Protect it.
