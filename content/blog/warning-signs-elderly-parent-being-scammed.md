Seniors lost a record-breaking $4.8 billion to fraud in 2024—an 83% increase from the previous year. But here's what's truly alarming: studies suggest the actual figure may be closer to $81.5 billion, as most elder fraud goes unreported due to shame or unawareness.

By the time families discover a scam, significant damage is often already done. Learning to recognise the early warning signs can save your parents' life savings.

## Financial Red Flags

### 1. Unexplained Bank Withdrawals

Large or frequent cash withdrawals that don't match their normal spending patterns. Scammers often instruct victims to withdraw cash to purchase gift cards or send wire transfers.

**What to watch for:** ATM withdrawals in round numbers (£500, £1,000), especially if your parent rarely used ATMs before.

### 2. New "Friends" They Send Money To

If your parent mentions sending money to someone you've never met—whether a romantic interest, a helpful stranger, or a supposed charity—this is a major red flag.

**What to watch for:** Mentions of helping someone overseas, new online relationships, or "investments" with guaranteed returns.

### 3. Suddenly Secretive About Finances

A parent who was always open about money becoming defensive or evasive may be hiding something—often because they've been told by scammers to keep it secret.

**What to watch for:** Hiding post, changing the subject about finances, or anger when you ask about their accounts.

### 4. Missing Valuables

Jewellery, electronics, or other valuables that have disappeared. Victims sometimes sell or pawn items to send money to scammers.

### 5. Unpaid Bills Despite Adequate Income

If your parent has always paid bills on time but suddenly has overdue notices, their money may be going elsewhere.

## Behavioural Changes

### 6. Increased Phone Activity

Spending more time on the phone, especially with people you don't know. Scammers build relationships over time, grooming victims through repeated calls.

**What to watch for:** Your parent being evasive about who they're talking to, stepping away to take calls, or increased mobile data usage.

### 7. Rushing to Answer the Phone

Many seniors feel obligated to answer every call. If your parent seems anxious about missing calls or rushes to pick up, they may be expecting contact from a scammer.

### 8. Stress or Anxiety About Money

Sudden worry about finances—especially if they were previously comfortable—can indicate they've lost money or are being pressured for more.

**What to watch for:** Comments like "I need to be more careful with money" or uncharacteristic penny-pinching.

### 9. Confusion About Recent Transactions

If your parent can't explain recent purchases or withdrawals, or their story keeps changing, they may be covering up scam-related activity.

### 10. Defensive When Asked Questions

Scammers often tell victims that family members "won't understand" or will try to stop them. If your parent becomes unusually defensive about new relationships or activities, take note.

## Physical and Communication Signs

### 11. Increased Post or Packages

Lottery scams, sweepstakes fraud, and fake prize notifications often arrive by post. Piles of official-looking letters from unfamiliar organizations are a warning sign.

**What to watch for:** Letters promising prizes, requests for "processing fees," or official-looking documents from unknown companies.

### 12. Gift Cards in Unusual Quantities

No legitimate organisation accepts payment in gift cards. If you find iTunes, Amazon, or Google Play cards around your parent's home, this is a serious red flag.

**What to watch for:** Gift card packaging in the bin, scratched-off cards, or receipts for multiple card purchases.

### 13. Computer Pop-Ups and "Tech Support"

If your parent mentions their computer had a virus that they paid to have fixed, or they've been receiving calls from "Microsoft," they may be a victim of tech support scams.

### 14. New Financial Accounts or Cards

Credit cards, loans, or accounts your parent doesn't remember opening. Scammers sometimes use stolen information to open accounts in victims' names.

### 15. Changes in Their Will or Beneficiaries

Sudden changes to legal documents, especially if influenced by a new person in their life, can indicate undue influence or fraud.

## What to Do If You Notice Warning Signs

### Don't Accuse or Shame

Your parent may already feel embarrassed or defensive. Approach with empathy: "I've been hearing about these scams that are really sophisticated. Have you gotten any strange calls lately?"

### Document Everything

Note dates, amounts, and any details your parent shares. This information will be valuable if you need to report the fraud or work with authorities.

### Report the Scam

- **Action Fraud** (UK): 0300 123 2040
- **National Elder Fraud Hotline** (US): 833-FRAUD-11
- **Bank Fraud Department**: Contact their bank immediately

### Get Proactive Protection

Prevention is easier than recovery. Consider tools that can detect scam patterns in real-time and alert you before significant losses occur.

## The Conversation Every Family Needs

Many families don't discuss scams until it's too late. Schedule a conversation with your parents about:

- The types of scams targeting seniors today
- Your family's "safe word" for verifying identity
- What to do if they receive a suspicious call
- That you won't judge them if something happens

## The Technology Gap

Today's scammers are sophisticated. They use AI to clone voices, spoofed caller IDs to appear legitimate, and psychological manipulation refined over millions of calls.

Your parents didn't grow up with this technology—and they shouldn't have to face it alone.
