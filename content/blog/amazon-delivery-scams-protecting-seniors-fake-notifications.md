Amazon accounts for approximately 80% of phishing attacks impersonating major brands. In the past year alone, Amazon has shut down 55,000+ phishing websites and disabled 12,000+ phone numbers used for impersonation fraud.

Your parents are receiving these messages. Some of them look incredibly convincing.

## How Amazon Scams Work

### The Fake Delivery Text

> "AMAZON: Your package could not be delivered. Update your address to avoid return: [suspicious link]"

> "Amazon: Unusual sign-in detected on your account. Verify immediately: [suspicious link]"

> "Your Amazon order #1847-2947 for £847.99 has shipped. If you didn't place this order, call 0800-XXX-XXXX"

These messages create urgency. Your parent clicks the link or calls the number—and walks into a trap.

### The New "Tariff" Scam

A recent variation targets seniors during package delivery:

> "USPS/Royal Mail: Your Amazon package requires £4.99 customs duty before delivery. Pay here: [link]"

Small amounts seem reasonable. Victims enter payment details on fake sites, giving scammers access to their accounts.

### The Fake Refund

> "Amazon Customer Service: You've been overcharged £149.99 on your recent order. Click here to claim your refund: [link]"

Who doesn't want a refund? The link leads to a fake site that harvests login credentials and payment information.

### The Phone Call Variant

Some scammers call directly:

> "This is Amazon Security. We've detected suspicious activity on your account. Someone may have placed a £1,200 order using your payment method. To cancel this order and secure your account, I'll need to verify your identity..."

The "verification" involves giving the scammer everything they need to access the account.

## Why Amazon Scams Target Seniors

### Familiarity

Many seniors use Amazon regularly. A message about their account doesn't seem unusual.

### Lower Tech Literacy

Distinguishing legitimate Amazon communications from sophisticated fakes requires digital fluency many seniors don't have.

### Fear of Account Compromise

The threat of someone using their payment methods triggers immediate protective action—exactly what scammers want.

### Trust in the Brand

Amazon is a known, trusted company. Messages claiming to be from Amazon inherit that trust.

## How to Identify Fake Amazon Messages

### Check the Sender

Legitimate Amazon emails come from addresses ending in @amazon.co.uk or @amazon.com. Scam emails use variations like:

- amazon-delivery@mail.com
- support@amaz0n.co.uk (note the zero)
- amazon-service@secure-verify.com

### Look at Links (Without Clicking)

Hover over links to see the actual URL. Legitimate Amazon links go to amazon.co.uk or amazon.com. Scam links go elsewhere.

### Grammar and Urgency

While scammers have improved, many fake messages still contain awkward phrasing, misspellings, or excessive urgency: "ACT NOW or lose access PERMANENTLY!"

### Amazon's Official Communication Channels

Amazon never:
- Asks for payment information via email or text
- Requests gift cards as payment
- Threatens account closure via SMS
- Sends login links via text message
- Calls asking for personal information

## Teaching Your Parents

### The Direct Login Rule

Instead of clicking links, always:
1. Open a new browser window
2. Type amazon.co.uk directly
3. Log in normally
4. Check account notifications there

Any legitimate issue will appear in the official account. If it doesn't, the message was fake.

### The Callback Rule

If someone calls claiming to be from Amazon, hang up and call Amazon's official customer service number from their website.

### The Gift Card Rule

Amazon will never ask for payment via gift cards. This single rule prevents countless scams.

### The Verification Pause

Before taking any action on an Amazon message:
1. Stop and take a breath
2. Check your actual Amazon account
3. Call Amazon directly if concerned
4. Contact family before providing information

## Real Examples

### The "Compromised Account" Scam

Helen, 73, received a call claiming her Amazon account had been hacked. To protect her money, she needed to purchase gift cards and give the codes to the "security team" to trace the hackers.

She bought £2,000 in Amazon gift cards before her daughter intervened.

### The "Failed Delivery" Scam

Bill, 77, clicked a link in a text about a delivery problem. The site looked exactly like Amazon. He entered his login credentials and payment information to "update his address."

Two days later, £3,400 was charged to his account for electronics shipped to another address.

### The "Refund" Trap

Doris, 80, received an email about a £200 refund. She clicked through and entered her bank details to "receive" the refund.

Instead, £400 was withdrawn from her account.

## Protecting Your Parents

### Set Up Account Alerts

Enable notifications for Amazon purchases. Any unauthorized order triggers an immediate alert.

### Enable Two-Factor Authentication

Adding 2FA to your parents' Amazon account means scammers can't access it with just the password.

### Review Account Regularly

Periodically check their Amazon account for unauthorized orders, suspicious login activity, or added payment methods.

### Install Scam Protection

AI-powered tools can identify Amazon phishing messages before your parents interact with them.

### Create a Family Support Channel

Make it easy for your parents to forward suspicious messages: "If you get any message from Amazon that seems strange, just forward it to me before doing anything."

## If Your Parent Has Been Scammed

### Contact Amazon Immediately

Report the incident through Amazon's official customer service. They may be able to:
- Reverse unauthorized charges
- Secure the account
- Identify compromised information

### Contact Their Bank

Report fraudulent charges and consider:
- New card numbers
- Account monitoring
- Fraud alerts

### Change Passwords

If credentials were compromised, change passwords immediately—and on any other accounts using the same password.

### Report the Scam

File reports with:
- Action Fraud (UK): 0300 123 2040
- FTC (US): reportfraud.ftc.gov
- Amazon's official report form

## The Ongoing Challenge

Scammers constantly evolve their tactics. Last month's obvious fake becomes this month's convincing impersonation.

The best protection combines:
- Education about current scam tactics
- Technical safeguards on accounts
- Easy communication with family
- AI-powered scam detection
