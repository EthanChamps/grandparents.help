The phone rings. An authoritative voice identifies as an IRS agent. Your parent owes back taxes. If they don't pay immediately, police will be dispatched, their benefits will be terminated, and they could face prison time.

Your parent is terrified. The caller sounds legitimate, knows their name, and has an official-sounding badge number.

But it's not the IRS. It never is.

Tax scams are the number one fraud targeting seniors according to former IRS Commissioners. The 65-74 age group is most targeted, with 37% receiving demands for immediate payment.

## How IRS Scams Work

### The Threatening Call

Scammers use fear as their primary weapon:

> "This is Officer Johnson from the Internal Revenue Service. Our records show you owe £8,749 in back taxes. A warrant has been issued for your arrest. You must pay immediately to avoid prosecution."

Variations include:
- Threats of deportation (even for citizens)
- Claims of suspended Social Security benefits
- Warnings of frozen bank accounts
- Announcements of pending lawsuits

### Caller ID Spoofing

The call appears to come from the IRS or a local police station. Your parent sees "IRS" or a government number on their phone—but caller ID can be faked.

### The Payment Demand

Scammers demand immediate payment via:
- Gift cards (iTunes, Google Play, Amazon)
- Wire transfers
- Cryptocurrency
- Prepaid debit cards

They stay on the line while victims purchase gift cards, preventing them from thinking clearly or seeking help.

### AI Voice Technology

In 2025, scammers have begun using AI to make calls sound even more convincing—including replicating accents and adding realistic background noise to simulate call centres.

## What the Real IRS Does

The IRS will **never**:

- **Call demanding immediate payment** without sending written notice first
- **Threaten arrest** for unpaid taxes
- **Demand specific payment methods** like gift cards or wire transfers
- **Ask for credit/debit card numbers** over the phone
- **Threaten deportation** or license revocation
- **Refuse to let you question** or appeal the amount owed

The IRS will **always**:

- **Send written notice** through the post as first contact
- **Give you time** to question or appeal amounts
- **Provide payment options** including installment plans
- **Let you verify** by calling them directly

## The Numbers Are Staggering

- **48%** of Americans have received fake IRS messages
- **65-74 year olds** are most frequently targeted
- **40%** of men aged 65-74 who fell for scams lost £751-£1,000
- **50%** of women who fell victim lost £2,501-£5,000
- Average IRS identity theft case takes **506 days** to resolve

## Tax Season Variations

### The Refund Scam

> "We've calculated that you're owed a £4,200 refund from the IRS. To process your refund, we need to verify your bank account information."

Victims provide banking details, and scammers drain their accounts.

### The Audit Threat

> "You've been selected for an IRS audit. To avoid penalties, you need to verify your Social Security number and tax information immediately."

This harvests personal information for identity theft.

### The Settlement Offer

> "The IRS is offering a one-time settlement. Pay £2,000 today to clear your £15,000 tax debt permanently."

Victims pay for "settlements" that don't exist.

## Why Seniors Are Vulnerable

### Fear of Authority

Many seniors grew up with deep respect for government institutions. A call claiming to be from the IRS triggers immediate compliance.

### Complexity of Tax Code

Tax laws are genuinely confusing. When someone claims they owe money, seniors may believe it's possible even if they've always paid their taxes.

### Isolation

Living alone means no one nearby to provide a reality check during a frightening call.

### Technology Unfamiliarity

Seniors may not know that caller ID can be spoofed or that the IRS doesn't operate this way.

## Teaching Your Parents

### The Hang-Up Protocol

Any threatening tax call should trigger immediate action:
1. Hang up without engaging
2. Wait 10 minutes (scammers sometimes call back immediately)
3. Call the IRS directly at 1-800-829-1040
4. Contact a family member before taking any action

### The Gift Card Rule

**No government agency accepts gift cards as payment.** This single rule prevents most tax scams. Repeat it until it's automatic.

### The Written Notice Rule

The IRS contacts taxpayers by mail first—always. Phone calls demanding immediate payment are never legitimate.

### Verification Resources

If your parent receives any suspicious IRS communication:
- **IRS Taxpayer Advocate**: 1-877-777-4778
- **IRS Identity Theft Line**: 1-800-908-4490
- **Treasury Inspector General**: 1-800-366-4484

## Real Stories

### The Gift Card Payment

Eleanor, 79, received a call claiming she owed £6,500 in back taxes. Terrified of arrest, she drove to three different stores purchasing gift cards while the "agent" stayed on the phone.

She read £6,500 in gift card numbers to the caller before her son discovered what happened.

### The Repeat Target

After falling for one IRS scam, Robert, 82, received another call from someone claiming to be from the "IRS Fraud Recovery Department." They offered to help recover his lost money—for a £500 processing fee.

He paid. This was also a scam.

## Protecting Your Parents

### Education First

Explain clearly how the real IRS operates. Many seniors genuinely don't know that the IRS doesn't call demanding immediate gift card payments.

### Create a Verification Protocol

Establish a family rule: Any call about money—especially from "government agencies"—requires verification before action.

### Enable Call Blocking

Use apps and phone features that identify and block known scam numbers. While scammers constantly change numbers, blocking reduces volume.

### Monitor for Warning Signs

Watch for:
- Unusual gift card purchases
- Anxiety about "government problems"
- Secretive phone calls
- Sudden interest in wire transfers or cryptocurrency

### Use AI-Powered Protection

Modern scam detection can identify IRS impersonation patterns in real-time, alerting family members before money changes hands.

## If Your Parent Has Been Victimised

### Report Immediately

- **Treasury Inspector General**: 1-800-366-4484
- **FTC**: reportfraud.ftc.gov
- **IRS**: phishing@irs.gov
- **Local police**: For documentation

### Document Everything

Record the phone numbers used, payment methods requested, amounts paid, and any information provided to scammers.

### Contact Financial Institutions

If banking information was shared, contact the bank immediately about potential fraud.

### Monitor for Identity Theft

If personal information was compromised:
- Freeze credit reports
- Set up fraud alerts
- Monitor for unusual activity

### Expect Follow-Up Scams

Victims are often targeted again with "recovery scams" or repeated attempts. Warn your parent that it's not over.
