They call it "pig butchering" because scammers fatten victims up before the slaughter.

It's the fastest-growing financial fraud in history. Seniors over 60 lost $2.8 billion to cryptocurrency scams in 2024—more than any other age group. The losses represent a 44% increase from the previous year.

And most victims never saw it coming.

## What Is Pig Butchering?

Pig butchering combines two devastating fraud types:

1. **Romance/friendship scams**: Building emotional connection over weeks or months
2. **Investment fraud**: Introducing fake cryptocurrency "opportunities"

The name comes from the Chinese phrase "shā zhū pán" (杀猪盘)—the victim is the pig being fattened for slaughter.

## How These Scams Work

### Phase 1: The Wrong Number

It often starts innocently:

> "Hi! Is this Jennifer? We met at the conference last week."

Or:

> "Sorry, wrong number! But since we're chatting, where are you from?"

The contact seems accidental. The scammer acts friendly, not pushy. Conversation continues casually.

### Phase 2: The Friendship

Over weeks, the scammer builds genuine-feeling connection:

- Daily good morning and good night messages
- Interest in your parent's life, family, hobbies
- Sharing photos (stolen from real social media accounts)
- Life philosophy discussions
- Stories about their own "success"

They mention they've done well financially through investments—but only in passing, without pressure.

### Phase 3: The Opportunity

Eventually, the scammer shares their "secret":

> "I've been making incredible returns through this investment platform. My uncle is a cryptocurrency analyst who gives me tips. I've made enough to retire early."

They offer to help your parent try it—small amounts first, just to see how it works.

### Phase 4: The Platform

Victims are directed to a professional-looking website or app. It shows real-time cryptocurrency prices and looks legitimate.

Small initial investments show immediate returns. Your parent can withdraw small amounts successfully—this builds trust.

> "See how easy it was? Imagine if you'd invested more!"

### Phase 5: The Butchering

Convinced the platform works, victims invest larger amounts—retirement savings, home equity, borrowed money.

Then the platform reveals "problems":

- **"Tax payments required"** before withdrawal
- **"Verification fees"** to access funds
- **"Temporary freezes"** requiring additional deposits

Every "problem" requires more money. Victims, desperate to recover their investment, keep paying.

Eventually, the platform disappears. The scammer vanishes. The money is gone.

## Why This Scam Is Devastating

### The Long Con

Unlike quick scams, pig butchering takes months. Victims form genuine emotional attachments. They don't just lose money—they lose a relationship they believed was real.

### The Shame Factor

Victims fell for both romance fraud and investment fraud. The embarrassment prevents reporting and seeking help.

### The Total Loss

Because victims are convinced to invest heavily, losses are catastrophic. Some lose entire retirement savings. Some take out loans. Some refinance homes.

### The Criminal Infrastructure

These aren't solo operators. Pig butchering operations are run by sophisticated criminal organizations, sometimes using trafficked workers forced to run scams.

## Warning Signs for Families

### New Online "Friends"

Is your parent spending a lot of time messaging someone they met online? Do they seem secretive about the relationship?

### Sudden Interest in Cryptocurrency

If your parent—who previously had no interest in digital currency—suddenly wants to invest in Bitcoin or crypto platforms, ask questions.

### Unexplained Financial Activity

Large withdrawals, new accounts, or discussions about "investments" they're vague about are red flags.

### Defensive Behaviour

Scammers coach victims to expect family interference: "They won't understand." If your parent becomes defensive about a new friendship or investment, something may be wrong.

### Time Pressure

Any investment requiring quick decisions is suspicious. Legitimate investments don't require immediate action.

## Protecting Your Parents

### Educate About the Tactic

Many seniors don't know pig butchering exists. Explain the basics:

> "There are scammers who spend months pretending to be friends or romantic partners. Then they convince victims to invest in fake cryptocurrency platforms. It's called pig butchering because they 'fatten you up' before taking everything."

### Establish Verification Rules

Before any investment over £500:
- Research the platform independently
- Consult with a licensed financial advisor
- Discuss with family members
- Wait at least 48 hours before committing

### Warn About "Wrong Number" Contacts

Explain that accidental text contacts are a common scam starting point. If someone texts by mistake and then wants to keep chatting, that's suspicious.

### Monitor Financial Behaviour

If possible, establish gentle oversight of financial accounts—not control, but awareness. Unusual activity triggers conversation.

### Use Protective Technology

AI-powered monitoring can identify pig butchering patterns: romantic language followed by investment discussion, mentions of cryptocurrency platforms, requests for secrecy.

## If Your Parent Is Already Involved

### Don't Attack the Relationship

If your parent is emotionally invested, direct attacks on the "friend" will push them away. Ask questions instead:

- "Have you video called with them?"
- "Can you verify their identity independently?"
- "Why can't you withdraw your initial investment?"
- "Would a real friend pressure you for money?"

### Contact Authorities

Report to:
- **FTC**: reportfraud.ftc.gov
- **FBI IC3**: ic3.gov (for US citizens)
- **Action Fraud**: 0300 123 2040 (UK)

### Seek Financial Recovery Help

While recovery is difficult, acting quickly helps:
- Contact your bank about recent transfers
- Report to the cryptocurrency exchange used (if legitimate)
- Consult with fraud recovery specialists

### Provide Emotional Support

Your parent lost money. But they also lost a relationship they believed was real. They'll need support processing both losses.

## The Bigger Picture

Pig butchering has grown because cryptocurrency enables anonymous, irreversible transfers. Once money is sent, it's nearly impossible to recover.

But the human element remains constant: scammers exploit loneliness, trust, and the desire for financial security.

Protecting your parents means addressing both the emotional vulnerability and the financial mechanics.
