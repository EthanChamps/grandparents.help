Medicare scams have become the number one fraud targeting seniors in 2025, with a staggering 40% increase compared to last year. During open enrollment season (October 15 - December 7), your parents may receive up to 60 fraudulent calls per day from scammers impersonating Medicare representatives.

## The Scale of the Problem

The numbers are alarming:

- **$60 billion** lost annually to Medicare fraud
- **40% surge** in Medicare scams in 2025
- **50-60 scam calls** per weekday during open enrollment
- **$3.58 billion** in improper Medicare Part D payments

Your parents are being targeted, and they may not even realise it.

## How Medicare Scams Work

### The "New Card" Scam

Scammers call claiming Medicare is issuing new cards. They ask your parent to "verify" their current Medicare number to receive the new card. Once they have the number, they can bill fraudulent services to Medicare and steal your parent's identity.

**What to tell your parents:** Medicare will never call to ask for your Medicare number. They already have it.

### The Genetic Testing Scam

This particularly insidious scam offers "free" DNA testing kits, claiming Medicare covers the cost. After obtaining the Medicare number and a cheek swab, scammers bill Medicare thousands of pounds for tests that may never be processed—or worse, use the DNA sample for further fraud.

### The "Better Plan" Scam

During open enrollment, scammers pose as insurance brokers offering plans with lower premiums and better coverage. These fake plans either don't exist or provide no actual coverage, leaving seniors without the protection they need.

## Warning Signs Your Parent Is Being Targeted

Watch for these red flags:

1. **Unsolicited calls** about Medicare benefits or new cards
2. **Pressure tactics** demanding immediate decisions
3. **Requests for Medicare numbers** over the phone
4. **Offers that sound too good** to be true
5. **Threats of losing benefits** if they don't act now
6. **Callers who won't provide written information**

## How to Protect Your Parents

### Set Up Call Screening

Modern scam protection tools can identify and block known scam numbers before they reach your parents. GuardRails analyses incoming calls and messages for fraud patterns, alerting you when suspicious activity is detected.

### Create a Verification Protocol

Establish a simple rule: **Never give Medicare information over the phone to someone who called you.** If Medicare or their insurance company needs to reach them, they should:

1. Hang up
2. Find the official number on their Medicare card
3. Call back directly

### Monitor Medicare Statements

Help your parents review their Medicare Summary Notices (MSN) regularly. Look for:

- Services they didn't receive
- Providers they've never visited
- Equipment they didn't order

### Use Real-Time Protection

AI-powered monitoring can detect scam language patterns in real-time. When GuardRails identifies a potential Medicare scam, it immediately alerts family members—even while the call is still happening.

## What Real Medicare Contact Looks Like

Medicare will:

- Send written notices in the post
- Never ask you to pay for a new card
- Never threaten to cancel your benefits for not "verifying" information
- Never demand immediate payment

Medicare will **not**:

- Call unexpectedly asking for personal information
- Offer deals or discounts over the phone
- Pressure you into immediate decisions
- Ask for payment via gift cards or wire transfer

## If Your Parent Has Been Targeted

If you suspect your parent has shared their Medicare number with scammers:

1. **Call Medicare immediately**: 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227)
2. **Report to the Senior Medicare Patrol**: 877-808-2468
3. **File a complaint** with the FTC at reportfraud.ftc.gov
4. **Monitor future statements** closely for fraudulent charges
5. **Consider identity theft protection** for ongoing monitoring

## The Bottom Line

Medicare scams exploit trust—seniors grew up in an era when you could trust a phone call. Today's fraudsters weaponise that trust.

The best defence is a combination of education, vigilance, and technology. Talk to your parents about these scams, help them understand the warning signs, and consider protective tools that can catch what they might miss.
