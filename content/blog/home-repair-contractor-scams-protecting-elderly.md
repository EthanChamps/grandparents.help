A knock at the door. A friendly contractor says they were working in the neighbourhood and noticed your parent's roof looks damaged. They can fix it today for a "special price"—but they need payment upfront.

Your parent pays. The "contractor" either disappears immediately or does substandard work that creates bigger problems.

Home repair scams are one of the most common frauds targeting seniors, with a median loss of £1,800 per victim. And unlike phone scams, these criminals show up at your parent's front door.

## How Home Repair Scams Work

### The "Neighbourhood Special"

Scammers canvass neighbourhoods with older residents, claiming:
- "We're doing work nearby and have leftover materials"
- "We noticed damage to your property"
- "We can offer a discount because we're already in the area"

The urgency is manufactured. The "damage" may be exaggerated or invented entirely.

### The Driveway Scam

Classic approach: "We just finished paving a neighbour's driveway and have extra asphalt. We can resurface yours for half price if you decide today."

The "asphalt" is often thin, low-quality material that deteriorates within months.

### The Storm Chaser

After severe weather, scammers descend on affected areas:
- "Your roof was damaged in the storm"
- "We're here to do emergency repairs"
- "Insurance will cover it—just sign here"

They may do minimal work, charge for phantom repairs, or actually cause damage to justify more work.

### The Bait and Switch

The initial quote is reasonable. But once work begins:
- "We found additional problems"
- "The damage is worse than expected"
- "This requires more expensive materials"

Final bills balloon to many times the original estimate.

## Warning Signs of Contractor Scams

### High-Pressure Tactics

- "This price is only good today"
- "We have the crew here now—we can't come back"
- "If you don't fix this immediately, it will get much worse"

Legitimate contractors don't pressure immediate decisions.

### Cash-Only or Upfront Payment Demands

- "We need the full amount before we start"
- "Cash only—no receipts"
- "Pay us now, we'll bill your insurance later"

Professional contractors take deposits (typically 10-30%), not full payment upfront.

### No Written Contract

Legitimate work requires written contracts specifying:
- Detailed scope of work
- Materials to be used
- Timeline for completion
- Payment schedule
- Warranties and guarantees

No contract = no protection.

### Unable to Provide Credentials

Ask any contractor for:
- Business licence
- Insurance certificate
- References from recent local jobs
- Physical business address

Scammers can't provide these.

### Door-to-Door Solicitation

While not all door-to-door contractors are scammers, this approach is a significant red flag—especially combined with pressure tactics or requests for immediate payment.

## Real Stories

### The Roof Repair

Harold, 83, was approached by workers claiming his roof was about to collapse. Frightened, he paid £8,000 in cash for "emergency repairs."

The workers spent two hours on the roof, did virtually nothing, and left. When Harold's son arranged an inspection, the roofer found no evidence of any work—and the roof had been fine all along.

### The Driveway Disaster

Elizabeth, 77, paid £3,500 for driveway resurfacing. The work looked fine initially, but within three months, cracks appeared everywhere.

The "contractor" had used a thin layer of sealant over the existing surface instead of proper resurfacing. The company's phone number was disconnected.

### The Escalating Bill

Thomas, 79, hired workers who quoted £500 to repair his porch steps. Midway through, they discovered "structural issues" requiring £4,000 in additional work.

Feeling he had no choice, Thomas paid. The finished work was shoddy and required professional correction costing another £6,000.

## Protecting Your Parents

### Establish a Family Rule

No home repair decisions over £500 without consulting family first. This creates a buffer against pressure tactics.

### Research Before Hiring

Before any work begins:
- Get multiple quotes (at least three)
- Check reviews online
- Verify licensing and insurance
- Ask for references and call them
- Confirm physical business address exists

### Never Pay Everything Upfront

Legitimate payment structures:
- Small deposit (10-30%) to begin
- Progress payments tied to milestones
- Final payment only after satisfactory completion
- Never more than 50% before work is completed

### Get Everything in Writing

A proper contract protects everyone. It should include:
- Complete description of work
- All materials specified
- Start and completion dates
- Total price and payment schedule
- Warranty information
- Cancellation policy

### Be Wary of Door-to-Door Offers

Teach your parents to say: "I need to discuss this with my family first. Leave your business card and I'll call you."

Legitimate contractors will understand. Scammers will pressure.

### Know the Cooling-Off Period

In the UK, doorstep sales contracts give consumers 14 days to cancel. In the US, the FTC provides 3 days for door-to-door sales over $25. Your parents have the right to change their mind.

## If Your Parent Has Been Scammed

### Document Everything

Photograph any work done (or not done), keep receipts, save contact information, and note dates and conversations.

### Report to Authorities

- **Trading Standards** (UK): Through Citizens Advice
- **FTC** (US): reportfraud.ftc.gov
- **State Attorney General** or local consumer protection office
- **Local police**: For criminal fraud

### Contact Your Bank

If payment was made by card, dispute the charge. Some banks offer protection against fraudulent services.

### Get Professional Assessment

Have a legitimate contractor assess what was done. This documentation may help with recovery efforts.

### Warn the Neighbourhood

If scammers targeted your parent, they're likely targeting neighbours too. Community awareness prevents additional victims.

## Legitimate vs. Fraudulent Contractors

| Legitimate | Fraudulent |
|------------|-----------|
| Provides written estimates | Verbal quotes only |
| Carries insurance | "Don't worry about insurance" |
| Has physical business address | PO Box or no address |
| Accepts reasonable payment terms | Demands cash upfront |
| Allows time to decide | Pressures immediate decision |
| Provides references | Vague about past work |
| Has proper licensing | "Working on getting licensed" |
| Offers warranties | No mention of guarantees |

## The Bigger Picture

Home repair scams exploit seniors' legitimate concerns about maintaining their homes. The fear that something is wrong—combined with limited resources to verify—makes them vulnerable.

The solution isn't to make your parents suspicious of everyone. It's to create systems that provide verification before decisions are made.
