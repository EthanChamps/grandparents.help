Romance scams cost victims $1.14 billion in 2023 alone, with seniors suffering the heaviest losses. For adults over 70, the median loss is $10,000—three times higher than younger victims. Beyond the money, these scams leave devastating emotional scars.

Nearly one in three adults over 65 lives alone. Scammers know this, and they exploit loneliness with ruthless precision.

## How Romance Scams Work

### The Setup

Romance scammers create elaborate fake identities—often using stolen photos of attractive, trustworthy-looking people. Common personas include:

- Military personnel stationed overseas
- Successful professionals working abroad
- Widowed individuals seeking connection
- Aid workers or missionaries in remote locations

They find victims on dating sites, Facebook, Instagram, and even Words With Friends or other game apps.

### The Grooming

Unlike other scams that demand immediate action, romance scammers invest weeks or months building emotional connections. They:

- Send thoughtful messages multiple times daily
- Remember and reference personal details
- Express deep romantic feelings quickly
- Create a sense of destiny or fate
- Become a significant part of the victim's daily life

### The Ask

Once emotional dependency is established, emergencies begin:

- Medical crisis for themselves or a family member
- Legal trouble requiring bail money
- Business emergency freezing their accounts
- Travel problems requiring immediate funds
- Customs fees to release valuable cargo

The requests start small and escalate. Victims who send £500 may eventually send £50,000 or more.

### The Disappearance

Once the scammer has extracted maximum funds—or the victim refuses to send more—they vanish completely, leaving the victim heartbroken and financially devastated.

## Warning Signs of a Romance Scammer

### They Won't Video Chat

Scammers using stolen photos can't appear on video. They'll always have excuses: poor internet, broken camera, work restrictions. If someone claims to love you but won't video call, this is a critical red flag.

### They're Always Overseas

Scammers invent reasons why they can't meet in person—military deployment, remote work location, travel restrictions. This also explains why they need wire transfers rather than meeting to collect money.

### Love Comes Fast

"Love bombing"—excessive flattery and premature declarations of love—is a manipulation technique. Real relationships develop gradually; scammers don't have time for that.

### Every Story Has an Emergency

Once money requests begin, there's always another crisis. Medical bills. Legal fees. Travel expenses. The emergencies never end until the money does.

### They Ask for Untraceable Payment

Wire transfers, gift cards, cryptocurrency—scammers request payment methods that can't be reversed. No legitimate romantic partner would ask you to buy iTunes cards to help them.

## Why Seniors Are Targeted

### Loneliness

After losing a spouse or facing isolation, the desire for connection makes seniors particularly vulnerable to someone who offers daily attention and affection.

### Trust

Many seniors grew up in an era when people were generally trustworthy. The concept that someone would spend months pretending to love them is difficult to accept.

### Financial Stability

Retirees often have savings, home equity, or pensions that scammers want to drain.

### Shame

Victims often keep the relationship secret, partly from the scammer's instructions and partly from embarrassment. This isolation makes it easier for the scam to continue.

## Real Stories

### The Widow Who Lost Everything

Margaret, 72, met "James" on a Facebook group for widows and widowers. Over six months, they talked daily. James was a military doctor stationed in Syria—kind, romantic, and planning their future together.

When James said he needed £8,000 to ship his medical equipment home so they could finally meet, Margaret took out a loan. Then came customs fees. Then complications. By the time her daughter discovered the messages, Margaret had sent £47,000.

James didn't exist. The photos belonged to a real military doctor whose identity had been stolen.

### The Retired Professor

David, 68, matched with "Linda" on a dating app. She claimed to be a nurse working with Médecins Sans Frontières. Their connection felt profound—she understood his intellectual interests and shared his values.

Over eight months, David sent £23,000 for various emergencies. His family only discovered the scam when his bank flagged unusual international transfers.

## How to Protect Your Parents

### Have the Conversation

Many seniors don't know romance scams exist. Explain—without condescension—how these scams work and why they're so effective.

### Encourage Verification

Suggest reverse image searches on profile photos. Teach them to video call early in any online relationship. Real people have no reason to hide.

### Stay Connected

Isolation enables scams. Regular contact with your parents means you're more likely to hear about new relationships and spot warning signs.

### Remove Shame

Make clear you won't judge them if something happens. Shame keeps victims silent while scammers drain their accounts.

### Use Protective Technology

AI-powered tools can detect romance scam patterns—phrases, requests, and behaviours that indicate fraud—and alert family members before significant money is lost.

## If Your Parent Is Already Involved

### Don't Attack the Relationship

Your parent may be deeply attached to this person emotionally. Direct attacks ("They're a scammer!") often backfire, pushing them to hide the relationship.

### Ask Questions

"What do you know about them that you've actually verified?" "Why can't they video chat?" "Would a real partner ask you to buy gift cards?"

### Involve Professionals

Contact your local Adult Protective Services or the National Elder Fraud Hotline (833-FRAUD-11). Trained counsellors can help navigate these conversations.

### Report the Scam

Even if no money was sent, reporting helps protect others. File reports with the FTC, IC3.gov, and the platform where contact occurred.

## The Long-Term Impact

Romance scam victims often suffer:

- Clinical depression
- Suicidal ideation
- Refusal to trust again
- Family relationship damage
- Financial devastation

Recovery requires emotional support, not judgment.

## The Truth About Modern Romance Scams

These aren't obvious Nigerian prince emails. Romance scammers are often part of sophisticated criminal operations, with detailed scripts, teams of people, and months of patience.

Your parents didn't do anything wrong by wanting connection. The scammers are professionals who exploit basic human needs.
