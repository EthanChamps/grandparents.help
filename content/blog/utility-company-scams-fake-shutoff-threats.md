"Your electricity will be disconnected in 45 minutes unless you pay the overdue balance immediately." The caller ID shows the power company's name. Your parent, terrified of losing heat in winter, rushes to comply.

But it's not the power company. It's a scammer.

Utility impersonation scams specifically target elderly people, particularly during extreme weather when the threat of losing power or heat feels life-threatening. One utility company reported £1 million in customer losses over just two years from these scams.

## How Utility Scams Work

### The Threatening Call

Scammers call claiming to represent:
- Electric companies
- Gas providers
- Water utilities
- Internet/phone services

They create immediate fear:
- "You owe £450 that's 90 days overdue"
- "Your power will be shut off in one hour"
- "A technician is already on the way"

### The Payment Trap

To prevent the "shutoff," victims must pay immediately via:
- Gift cards (iTunes, Google Play, Amazon)
- Prepaid debit cards
- Wire transfers
- Cryptocurrency
- Payment apps

These methods are untraceable—exactly why scammers demand them.

### The QR Code Variation

A newer tactic: Scammers send fake bills or notices with QR codes leading to fraudulent payment sites. Victims think they're paying their utility company but are actually sending money to criminals.

### The Door-to-Door Variation

Some scammers appear in person wearing fake utility company uniforms:
- "We're here to replace your meter"
- "There's a gas leak we need to investigate"
- "We need to verify your account"

They gain entry to steal valuables, gather account information, or pressure immediate "payments."

## Why Seniors Are Targeted

### Fear of Losing Utilities

For seniors, especially those with health conditions, losing power or heat isn't just inconvenient—it can be dangerous. Scammers exploit this genuine fear.

### Isolation

Seniors living alone have no one nearby to provide a reality check when a frightening call comes in.

### Trust in Caller ID

Many seniors don't know that caller ID can be spoofed to show any name or number.

### Fixed Schedules

Seniors are more likely to be home during the day when scam calls peak, and more likely to answer unfamiliar numbers.

## What Real Utility Companies Do

Legitimate utility providers will **never**:

- **Threaten immediate shutoff** without prior written notice
- **Demand gift cards** as payment
- **Require cryptocurrency** or wire transfers
- **Send someone without advance notice**
- **Ask for sensitive account information** over unsolicited calls
- **Pressure immediate payment** within minutes

Real utilities **always**:

- **Send written notices** before any disconnection
- **Provide multiple warnings** over time
- **Accept standard payment methods** (cheques, cards, online portals)
- **Allow payment plans** for those struggling
- **Schedule appointments** in advance with confirmation

## Seasonal Targeting

### Winter Scams

Cold weather creates the most fear. Losing heat in winter can be dangerous, especially for seniors.

> "Your gas will be shut off tonight. The temperature is dropping to -10°C. Pay now to avoid disconnection."

### Summer Scams

Heat waves create similar urgency around air conditioning:

> "Your power account is past due. We're disconnecting service today—during the hottest week of the year."

### Storm Season

After major weather events, scammers claim:

> "Your power is scheduled for restoration, but there's an outstanding balance that must be paid first."

## Teaching Your Parents

### The Written Notice Rule

Legitimate disconnections always come with written warning first—usually multiple notices over several weeks. Immediate phone threats are always scams.

### The Callback Protocol

If a call seems urgent:
1. Hang up
2. Find your utility bill or statement
3. Call the number printed on the bill (not any number the caller provides)
4. Verify the account status directly

### The Gift Card Rule

No utility company—anywhere, ever—accepts gift cards as payment. This is 100% a scam signal.

### The Visitor Protocol

If someone appears claiming to be from a utility:
- Ask for official ID
- Call the utility company to verify the visit
- Never let strangers inside without verification
- Don't pay anyone who comes to your door

## Real Stories

### The Winter Threat

Dorothy, 81, received a call in January claiming her gas would be shut off within the hour. Terrified of losing heat, she drove to buy £500 in gift cards while the "representative" stayed on the phone.

Her daughter discovered the scam when Dorothy mentioned the "emergency payment" that evening. The real gas company had no record of any balance issues.

### The Smart Meter Scam

Robert, 76, was told by a caller that his "smart meter had been tampered with" and he faced criminal prosecution unless he paid £900 immediately.

He was purchasing prepaid cards when a store clerk—trained to watch for scams—intervened and helped him verify with the real utility company. There was no tampering and no outstanding balance.

### The Door Scam

Helen, 79, allowed two men in utility uniforms into her home to "investigate a gas leak." While one distracted her, the other searched the house.

£300 in cash and jewellery were stolen. The utility company confirmed no technicians were scheduled to visit her address.

## Protecting Your Parents

### Program Real Numbers

Save legitimate utility company phone numbers in your parents' contacts. If they receive a concerning call, they can easily find the real number.

### Set Up Account Alerts

Most utilities offer email or text alerts for billing and account issues. Real notifications come through these channels, not random phone calls.

### Review Bills Together

Periodic review of utility bills helps your parents know their actual account status—making fake past-due threats less believable.

### Establish a Verification Rule

Before any payment based on a phone call: "I need to verify this by calling you back on the number on my bill."

### Use Scam Protection Technology

AI-powered monitoring can identify utility scam patterns—threatening language, payment demands, urgency tactics—and alert family members in real-time.

## If Your Parent Falls Victim

### Report Immediately

Contact the real utility company to report the scam. They can:
- Verify actual account status
- Flag the scam in their system
- Provide resources for victims

### File Official Reports

- **Action Fraud** (UK): 0300 123 2040
- **FTC** (US): reportfraud.ftc.gov
- **Utility company's fraud department**
- **Local police**

### Document Everything

Note the phone number used, payment method requested, amount lost, and what was said. This helps with reports and potential recovery.

### Watch for Repeat Attempts

Scammers often share victim information. Your parent may receive follow-up scam attempts—including fake "fraud recovery" calls.
