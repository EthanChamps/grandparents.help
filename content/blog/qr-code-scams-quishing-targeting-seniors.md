Your parent sees a QR code on a parking meter, restaurant table, or piece of mail. They scan it with their phone—just like they've been taught. The website looks legitimate. They enter their payment details.

They've just been "quished."

QR code scams—called "quishing"—have exploded as a new attack vector. In 2025, 26 million Americans were directed to malicious sites via fake QR codes. And seniors are particularly vulnerable because they've only recently learned to use this technology.

## What Is Quishing?

Quishing combines QR codes with phishing. Criminals create malicious QR codes that direct victims to fake websites designed to steal:

- Login credentials
- Payment information
- Personal data
- Bank account details

The code itself looks identical to a legitimate one. The danger is invisible until it's too late.

## How QR Code Scams Work

### The Sticker Scam

Scammers place fake QR code stickers over legitimate ones in public spaces:
- Parking meters (redirects to fake payment sites)
- Restaurant tables (fake ordering systems)
- Public transit stations (fake ticket purchases)
- Business windows (fake promotional offers)

Your parent thinks they're paying for parking. They're actually entering their card details on a criminal's website.

### The Mail Scam

Official-looking letters arrive with QR codes claiming to be from:
- Banks requiring "verification"
- Utility companies demanding "immediate payment"
- Government agencies requesting "document updates"
- Delivery services needing "redelivery fees"

### The Package Scam

The FBI has issued urgent warnings about QR codes included in unsolicited packages. Scanning leads to sites that harvest personal information or install malware.

### The Tariff Scam

A new 2025 variation: QR codes on fake customs notices claiming packages require "tariff payment" before delivery.

## Why This Scam Is Particularly Dangerous

### New Technology, New Trust

QR codes became mainstream during the pandemic. Seniors learned to trust them as a safe, contactless way to interact. Scammers exploit this newly established trust.

### Visual Legitimacy

Unlike suspicious links that might look strange, QR codes appear identical whether legitimate or malicious. There's no visual warning.

### Mobile Vulnerability

QR codes are designed for mobile phones, which have smaller screens and often don't display full URLs. Victims may not notice they're on a fake site.

### Bypass Traditional Filters

Email spam filters catch suspicious links. QR codes bypass these protections entirely because the link is hidden in the image.

## The Statistics Are Alarming

- **26 million** Americans directed to malicious sites via fake QR codes
- **26%** of all malicious links now delivered via QR codes
- **73%** of Americans scan QR codes without verification
- **89%** of QR attacks aim to steal login credentials
- **£25 million+** in losses from parking meter QR scams alone

## Teaching Your Parents QR Code Safety

### When to Scan

QR codes are generally safe in controlled environments:
- **Restaurant menus** (but verify the URL before entering payment info)
- **Product packaging** (from sealed, legitimate products)
- **Official documents** (received through expected channels)

### When NOT to Scan

Be suspicious of QR codes that:
- Appear on stickers (may be covering legitimate codes)
- Arrive in unexpected mail
- Are included in unsolicited packages
- Create urgency ("Scan immediately to avoid fees!")
- Promise prizes or special offers

### The Manual Alternative

When in doubt, don't scan. Instead:
- Type the website address directly
- Search for the company by name
- Call the organisation using a verified number
- Ask staff if the QR code is legitimate

### Check the URL

After scanning, before entering any information:
- Look at the website address in the browser
- Does it match the expected company?
- Is it HTTPS (secure)?
- Does it contain typos or strange characters?

## Real QR Code Scam Scenarios

### The Parking Meter

Sandra, 72, scanned a QR code on a parking meter in her local shopping centre. The website looked like a legitimate parking payment system. She entered her card details.

Three days later, £2,400 was charged to her card. The QR code had been a sticker placed over the legitimate one.

### The Bank Letter

George, 78, received an official-looking letter from his "bank" requesting account verification via QR code. The website replicated his bank's login page perfectly.

He entered his online banking credentials. Within hours, his account was emptied.

### The Restaurant Table

Dorothy, 81, scanned what she thought was the restaurant's ordering system. After entering her card details, she noticed the charges were going to a company she didn't recognise.

The QR code on her table had been swapped overnight.

## Protecting Your Parents

### Educate About the New Threat

Many seniors have only recently learned to use QR codes. They may not know that this "safe" technology can be weaponised.

### Enable URL Preview

Most phones can show a preview of where a QR code leads before opening. Enable this feature and teach your parents to check before tapping.

### Use Built-In Scanners

The default camera app is safer than third-party QR scanner apps, which may themselves be malicious.

### Install Security Software

Mobile security apps can warn about malicious websites, even when accessed via QR code.

### Encourage Questions

Create a family culture where asking "should I scan this?" is encouraged, not embarrassing.

## If Your Parent Scanned a Malicious Code

### If They Just Scanned (No Information Entered)

- Close the browser immediately
- Run a security scan on the phone
- Monitor for unusual device behaviour
- Change passwords if prompted to log in anywhere

### If They Entered Payment Information

- Contact their bank immediately
- Freeze the compromised card
- Monitor statements for fraudulent charges
- Report to Action Fraud (UK) or FTC (US)

### If They Entered Login Credentials

- Change passwords immediately (from a different device)
- Enable two-factor authentication
- Check for unauthorised account access
- Monitor connected accounts

## The Evolving Threat

QR scam techniques are advancing rapidly:

- **Dynamic QR codes** that change destinations based on time or location
- **Overlay attacks** where legitimate codes are physically covered
- **Social engineering** combining QR codes with phone calls
- **AI-generated websites** that perfectly mimic legitimate brands

The technology used to protect us is being turned against us. Awareness is the first line of defence.

## The Simple Rules

1. **Be suspicious of public QR codes**—especially stickers
2. **Check URLs before entering information**
3. **Never scan QR codes from unexpected mail or packages**
4. **When in doubt, type the address manually**
5. **Report suspicious QR codes** to the relevant business or authority
