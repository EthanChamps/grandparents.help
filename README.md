A Family Defense Platform that helps seniors navigate technology safely while giving adult children visibility into potential scams and tech issues.

## What is this?

**GuardRails** is a PWA with two interfaces:
- **Senior View**: Radically simple. Giant buttons. Voice-first. "What is this?" camera for scanning letters/screens.
- **Family Dashboard**: Activity feed, security alerts, subscription management.

## Key Features

- **Scam Detection**: AI-powered image analysis flags suspicious letters, emails, and messages
- **Tech Concierge**: Voice Q&A for common tech questions ("How do I send a photo on WhatsApp?")
- **Family Alerts**: Real-time notifications when potential scams are detected
- **Financial Firewall**: AI refuses to help with money transfers, crypto, or password sharing

## Tech Stack

- PWA (Web App, no app store friction)
- Vision AI (GPT-4o / Gemini 1.5 Pro)
- RAG for verified tech support answers

## Status

🚧 **Pre-development** — See [PROJECT_SPEC.md](./PROJECT_SPEC.md) for full plan.
